Toogles: Awesome Goggles for YouTube
====================================

Toogles is a super fast and super clean alternative interface for YouTube.
It's built for people who want to watch and browse and search without the
bulk that comes along with YouTube.com

Toogles is built on top of Angular.js (no jQuery) and Zurb Foundation.

### Contributing (it's only 5 commands!)

Toogles is a single page JS app with no back end, so it's incredibly easy
to set up locally. 

    git clone <your-fork-url>
    cd <your-fork-directory>
    npm install 
    bower install
    grunt serve

That last command will start a lightweight server and open your browser to the
URL for testing and development. It uses LiveReload internally so all code changes
should automatically refresh, and it also will watch your .scss files to compile
to CSS on the fly.

Feel free to hack on it to fix any bugs you find or add any features you'd
like and send them in as a pull request. I'll add you to the contributors section!
